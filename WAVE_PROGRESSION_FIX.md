# Wave Progression Fix

## üîß **Issue Identified**
After fixing the collision issue, the first wave completes successfully but no enemies spawn for wave 2.

## ‚úÖ **Fixes Applied**

### 1. **Restored Automatic Wave Progression**
- Re-enabled the 3-second delay and automatic next wave start in `complete_wave()`
- Added comprehensive debug output to track wave transitions

### 2. **Enhanced Wave Completion Detection**
- Added detailed logging when all enemies are destroyed
- Shows enemy count and wave completion status
- Tracks the complete_wave() call chain

### 3. **Improved Wave Start Process**
- Added debug output to show wave setup process
- Tracks enemy clearing, formation generation, and spawn queue setup
- Shows wave_complete flag reset

### 4. **Manual Wave Testing**
- Added Enter key handler to manually start next wave (for debugging)
- Allows testing wave progression if automatic fails

## üéÆ **Expected Debug Output**

### **When Last Enemy Dies:**
```
=== ALL ENEMIES DESTROYED ===
Enemies alive: 0
Wave complete flag: false
Calling complete_wave()...

=== WAVE COMPLETION ===
Wave 1 complete!
wave_complete_signal emitted
all_enemies_destroyed signal emitted
Wave complete! Starting next wave in 3 seconds...
```

### **After 3 Second Delay:**
```
Starting next wave...
=== EnemyManager.start_wave() called with wave 2 ===
Starting wave 2
Resetting wave_complete flag to: false

=== CLEARING ALL ENEMIES ===
Enemies to clear: 0
Enemies cleared. Array size now: 0

Generating formation positions...
Wave 2 will spawn 12 enemies
Spawn queue has 12 positions
```

### **Then Enemy Spawning:**
```
Spawning enemy... (12 remaining)
spawn_next_enemy() called
Enemy added to scene. Total enemies alive: 1
```

## üöÄ **Test Instructions**

1. **Complete Wave 1** - destroy all 12 enemies
2. **Watch console** for wave completion debug messages
3. **Wait 3 seconds** - should see "Starting next wave..."
4. **Look for Wave 2 enemies** - should spawn automatically
5. **If no enemies spawn** - press Enter to manually start next wave

## üîç **Troubleshooting**

**If Wave 2 doesn't start automatically:**
- Check if you see "=== ALL ENEMIES DESTROYED ===" message
- Look for "complete_wave()" call
- Check if 3-second timer completes
- Use Enter key to manually trigger next wave

**If enemies don't spawn in Wave 2:**
- Check if "start_wave() called with wave 2" appears
- Look for formation generation messages
- Check spawn queue size (should be 12)
- Verify enemy scene is still loaded

The wave progression should now work automatically with clear debug feedback showing exactly what's happening at each step!
