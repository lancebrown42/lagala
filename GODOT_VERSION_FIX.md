# Godot 4.4.1 Apple Silicon Input Bug Fix

## Confirmed Issue:
- **Godot Version**: 4.4.1
- **System**: Apple M1 Pro, macOS 14.7.6
- **Problem**: Input events not detected (known bug in 4.4.1 on Apple Silicon)

## Solution 1: Downgrade to Godot 4.3.2 (Recommended)
Godot 4.3.2 has better Apple Silicon input stability:

1. **Download Godot 4.3.2 Apple Silicon**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/godotengine/godot/releases/tag/4.3.2-stable
   - Download: `Godot_v4.3.2-stable_macos.universal.zip`

2. **Install and Test**:
   - Extract and replace your current Godot
   - Open the lagala project
   - Run the MinimalTest scene (CMD+B)

## Solution 2: Try Godot 4.4.0 (Alternative)
If 4.3.2 doesn't work, try 4.4.0:
- Download from: https://github.com/godotengine/godot/releases/tag/4.4-stable

## Solution 3: Use Development Build
Try the latest development build which may have the fix:
- Download from: https://godotengine.org/download/preview/

## Quick Test After Version Change:
1. Open lagala project in new Godot version
2. Run MinimalTest scene (CMD+B)  
3. Try pressing any key or clicking
4. Check if you see "INPUT DETECTED!" in console

## Expected Result:
With working Godot version, you should see:
```
=== MINIMAL TEST STARTED ===
Godot version: 4.3.2.stable.official
Platform: macOS
...
INPUT DETECTED! Type: InputEventKey
  KEY EVENT - Code: 65 Pressed: true
  Key pressed successfully!
```

## If Version Change Doesn't Work:
Then we'll try the permission/system fixes, but version incompatibility is the most likely cause.
