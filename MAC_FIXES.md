# Mac-Specific Fixes for Lagala

## Current Status
- Changed to Mobile renderer with GL Compatibility
- Created ultra-simple test scene
- Added Mac-specific debugging
- Simplified input configuration

## If Test Scene Still Doesn't Work:

### Fix 1: Godot Version
Make sure you're using Godot 4.4+ (not 4.3 or earlier)
- Download latest from: https://godotengine.org/download/macos/

### Fix 2: Mac Permissions
Godot might need permissions:
1. System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy
2. Add Godot to "Accessibility" if needed
3. Add Godot to "Input Monitoring" if needed

### Fix 3: Renderer Issues
Try different renderers in Project Settings:
1. Rendering > Renderer > Rendering Method
2. Try: Mobile, Forward+, or Compatibility

### Fix 4: Alternative Testing
Instead of CMD+B, try:
1. F5 (Play Project) in editor
2. F6 (Play Current Scene) in editor
3. Click the Play button in editor toolbar

### Fix 5: Clean Project
1. Close Godot
2. Delete .godot folder in project
3. Reopen project in Godot
4. Let it reimport everything

## Debug Information Needed:
When you run the test scene, please report:
1. What do you see in the window?
2. What console output appears?
3. What happens when you click the button?
4. What happens when you press keys?
5. Any error messages?

## Expected Output:
```
=== MAC DEBUG INFO ===
OS: macOS
Godot version: {...}
Renderer: mobile
...
=== TEST SCENE LOADED ON MAC ===
âœ“ Button found
âœ“ Button connected
âœ“ Label found
```

When you click button or press T:
```
ðŸŽ‰ BUTTON CLICKED SUCCESSFULLY!
```
