# Enemy Scene Loading Fix

## 🔧 **Issue Identified**
The Enemy.tscn file had parse errors on line 13, preventing it from loading. This caused `enemy_scene` to be null, so no enemies could spawn.

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### 1. **Recreated Enemy.tscn**
- Fixed malformed resource IDs and ExtResource references
- Proper UID format: `uid://bqxvn8j8k2h2r`
- Correct ExtResource naming: `id="1_enemy"`
- Proper SubResource naming: `id="RectangleShape2D_enemy"`

### 2. **Added Robust Error Handling**
- Enhanced debug output in EnemyManager
- Fallback enemy scene creation if loading fails
- Automatic retry of scene loading
- Detailed logging of instantiation process

### 3. **Comprehensive Debug Output**
- Shows exactly where enemy creation fails
- Validates enemy methods and signals exist
- Tracks enemy position and visibility
- Reports scene loading success/failure

## 🎮 **Expected Behavior Now**

When you run the game, you should see:

```
EnemyManager initialized
Loading Enemy scene...
Enemy scene loaded successfully
Enemy scene resource path: res://scenes/Enemy.tscn

=== EnemyManager.start_wave() called with wave 1 ===
Starting wave 1
Wave 1 will spawn 12 enemies

Spawning enemy... (12 remaining)
spawn_next_enemy() called
Spawning enemy at formation position: (160, 100)
Instantiating enemy from scene...
Enemy instantiated: true
Enemy type: CharacterBody2D
Enemy added to scene. Total enemies alive: 1
```

## 🔍 **If Still Not Working**

The debug output will now show exactly what's failing:

**Scene Loading Issues:**
- "ERROR: Could not load Enemy scene!" → Scene file still has problems
- "ERROR: Still could not load enemy scene!" → Persistent loading failure

**Instantiation Issues:**
- "ERROR: Failed to instantiate enemy!" → Scene loads but can't create instances
- "Enemy instantiated: false" → Instantiation returning null

**Method/Signal Issues:**
- "WARNING: Enemy does not have [method]" → Script not attached properly
- Signal connection warnings → Enemy script missing signals

## 🚀 **Test Instructions**

1. **Run the game** and check console for enemy loading messages
2. **Click "START GAME"** and look for spawning debug output
3. **Press ESC** to test direct enemy creation (should work now)
4. **Look for red enemy sprites** appearing at the top and moving to formation

The Enemy.tscn file is now properly formatted and should load without parse errors. The enhanced debug output will show you exactly what's happening during the spawning process!
