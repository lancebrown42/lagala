scenes/Enemy.tscn             - Enemy scene with collision
scripts/Phase3Tester.gd       - Testing framework for Phase 3
```

### Modified Files
```
scripts/Main.gd               - Added EnemyManager integration
scripts/PlayerBullet.gd       - Enhanced enemy collision detection

project.godot                 - Reset main scene to Main.tscn
```

### Collision System
- **Player Group**: "player" - for enemy collision detection
- **Enemy Group**: "enemies" - for bullet collision detection  
- **Player Bullets Group**: "player_bullets" - for enemy collision detection
- **Area2D Collision**: Enemies use Area2D for bullet detection
- **CharacterBody2D**: Enemies use CharacterBody2D for movement physics

### Signal Architecture
```
Enemy Signals:
- enemy_destroyed(enemy, points) â†’ EnemyManager
- enemy_hit_player(enemy) â†’ EnemyManager

EnemyManager Signals:
- enemy_destroyed_signal(points) â†’ Main
- wave_complete_signal(wave_number) â†’ Main
- all_enemies_destroyed â†’ Main

Integration:
EnemyManager â†’ Main â†’ GameManager (score updates)
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps (Phase 4)

### Immediate Improvements

## ðŸ§ª Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Enemies spawn in formation when game starts
- [ ] Player bullets destroy enemies and award points
- [ ] Enemies occasionally perform diving attacks
- [ ] Enemies return to formation after diving
- [ ] Wave progresses automatically when all enemies destroyed
- [ ] Score increases when enemies are destroyed
- [ ] Player loses life when hit by enemy
- [ ] Game over works when all lives lost

### Automated Testing
- Run Phase3Tester.gd to validate all systems are properly implemented
- All scripts load correctly
- All scenes instantiate properly
- Collision groups are set up correctly

## ðŸš€ How to Play

### Controls (Unchanged)
- **A/D or Arrow Keys**: Move player ship
- **Space**: Shoot (max 3 bullets on screen)
- **Escape**: Pause/Resume game

### New Gameplay Elements
- **Enemy Formation**: Enemies appear in classic Galaga formation
- **Diving Attacks**: Watch for enemies breaking formation to attack
- **Wave Progression**: Survive each wave to progress to the next
- **Scoring**: Destroy enemies to increase your score

The core game loop is now fully functional with enemies that spawn, move in formation, attack the player, and can be destroyed for points. The foundation is set for adding more advanced Galaga features!
