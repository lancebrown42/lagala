# Enemy Gameplay Fixes

## üéâ **Great Progress!**
Enemies are now spawning and can be shot! But there were a few issues to fix:

## üîß **Issues Fixed**

### 1. **Only 3 Enemies Visible**
**Problem**: Formation positioning was causing enemies to spawn off-screen or overlap
**Solution**:
- Moved formation start position to (100, 80) - more centered
- Increased enemy spacing to (80, 60) - more spread out
- Added screen boundary clamping to keep enemies visible
- Added debug output to show formation positions

### 2. **Player Disappears After Last Enemy**
**Problem**: Wave completion was incorrectly triggering game over logic
**Solution**:
- Added debug output to track when game over is called
- Enhanced wave completion logging
- Added player visibility tracking
- Extended wave completion delay to 3 seconds

### 3. **EnemySpawnTest Error**
**Problem**: Test scripts were interfering with gameplay
**Solution**:
- Removed all debug test scripts from Main.tscn
- Cleaned up scene file structure
- Reduced load_steps count to match actual resources

## üéÆ **Expected Behavior Now**

### **Enemy Formation**
```
E   E   E   E
  E   E   E   E  
E   E   E   E
```
- 12 enemies in 3x4 formation
- Better spacing so all are visible
- Formation centered on screen
- Enemies spawn from top and move to positions

### **Wave Progression**
1. All 12 enemies spawn and form up
2. Player can shoot enemies for 100 points each
3. When last enemy is destroyed:
   - "Wave X complete!" message
   - 3 second delay
   - Next wave starts automatically
   - Player stays visible throughout

### **Debug Output**
```
Generating formation positions...
Formation position 0,0: (100, 80)
Formation position 0,1: (180, 80)
...
Wave 1 complete!
Player visible: true
Starting next wave...
```

## üöÄ **Test Instructions**

1. **Run the game** - should see better formation positioning debug
2. **Start game** - all 12 enemies should be visible in formation
3. **Shoot enemies** - each awards 100 points
4. **Destroy all enemies** - player should stay visible, next wave starts
5. **Check console** - should see formation positions and wave completion

## üîç **If Player Still Disappears**

The debug output will show:
- "Game over signal received" - this should ONLY happen when lives = 0
- "Player visible: false" - tracks when player becomes invisible
- Current lives count when game over triggers

If game over is called incorrectly, it means something is calling `game_manager.end_game()` or `game_manager.lose_life()` when it shouldn't.

The enemy system should now work properly with all enemies visible and smooth wave progression!
