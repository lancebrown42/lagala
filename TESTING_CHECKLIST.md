# Lagala Phase 1 Testing Checklist

## Automated Tests Results ✅
- ✅ Project structure is complete
- ✅ All required files are present
- ✅ GDScript syntax validation passed
- ✅ Project configuration is correct

## Manual Testing Instructions

### To test in Godot Editor:

1. **Open Project**
   - Launch Godot 4.4+
   - Click "Import" and select the `project.godot` file
   - The project should open without errors

2. **Scene Loading Test**
   - The Main scene should be set as the main scene
   - Open `scenes/Main.tscn` in the editor
   - Check that all nodes are present:
     - Main (Node2D)
     - GameManager (Node)
     - UI (CanvasLayer)
     - HUD, StartScreen, GameOverScreen (Control nodes)

3. **Script Attachment Test**
   - Main node should have `Main.gd` attached
   - GameManager node should have `GameManager.gd` attached
   - No script errors should appear in the editor

4. **Run the Game (F5)**
   - Press F5 or click the Play button
   - **Expected behavior:**
     - Window opens at 640x480 resolution
     - Start screen appears with "LAGALA" title
     - Instructions are visible
     - "START GAME" button is present

5. **UI Flow Test**
   - Click "START GAME" button
   - **Expected behavior:**
     - Start screen disappears
     - HUD appears showing "SCORE: 0" and "LIVES: 3"
     - Game is now in PLAYING state

6. **Input Test**
   - Press ESC key
   - **Expected behavior:**
     - Game should pause (if implemented)
     - Console should show "Game Paused" message

7. **Console Output Test**
   - Check the Godot console for debug messages:
     - "Lagala Game Manager initialized"
     - "Main scene loaded"
     - "Game loop started" (when game begins)

## Known Limitations in Phase 1
- No player ship visible yet (Phase 2)
- No enemies visible yet (Phase 3)
- No actual gameplay mechanics (Phases 2-3)
- Game over screen only accessible programmatically

## If Issues Are Found:

### Common Issues and Solutions:

1. **Scene won't load**
   - Check that all script paths are correct
   - Verify that `res://` paths match actual file locations

2. **Scripts have errors**
   - Check for typos in class names or function names
   - Verify that all `@onready` variables reference existing nodes

3. **Input not working**
   - Check Project Settings > Input Map
   - Verify that input actions are properly defined

4. **UI elements not visible**
   - Check node visibility settings
   - Verify that CanvasLayer is properly configured

## Success Criteria for Phase 1:
- ✅ Project opens in Godot without errors
- ✅ Main scene loads and runs
- ✅ Start screen displays correctly
- ✅ UI transitions work (start screen → game HUD)
- ✅ Input system is configured
- ✅ Game state management functions
- ✅ Console shows appropriate debug messages

## Next Steps:
Once Phase 1 testing is complete, proceed to Phase 2: Player Ship Implementation
