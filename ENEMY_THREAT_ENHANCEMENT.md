## ⚔️ **Enemy Threat Enhancements**

### 1. **More Frequent Diving Attacks**
```gdscript
# Before: randf() < 0.001  (very rare)
# After:  randf() < 0.005  (5x more frequent)
```
**Result:** Enemies dive toward player much more often

### 2. **Deeper Dive Attacks**
```gdscript
# Before: screen_size.y - 100  (stayed high)
# After:  screen_size.y - 30   (go much lower)
```
**Result:** Enemies come dangerously close to player

### 3. **Faster Dive Speed**
```gdscript
# Before: speed * 3.0
# After:  speed * 4.0
```
**Result:** Diving attacks are faster and harder to avoid

### 4. **Enhanced Formation Movement**
```gdscript
# Before: Simple horizontal sway (10.0)
# After:  Dynamic horizontal (15.0) + vertical (8.0) sway
```
**Result:** Formation looks more alive and threatening

### 5. **Progressive Formation Descent**
- **Every 15 seconds** formation moves down by 10 pixels
- **Increases pressure** as game progresses
- **Forces player action** - can't just hide at bottom

### 6. **Bottom Screen Threat**
- **Enemies that reach bottom** damage the player
- **Automatic destruction** after hitting bottom
- **Real consequence** for letting enemies get too low

## 🎮 **Expected Gameplay Changes**

### **Before (Passive):**
- Enemies mostly stayed in formation
- Rare diving attacks that didn't threaten much
- Player could safely camp at bottom
- Low pressure, easy to survive

### **After (Aggressive):**
- **5x more diving attacks** - constant threat
- **Enemies dive to bottom** - real danger zone
- **Formation moves down** - increasing pressure
- **Bottom hits damage player** - can't camp safely

### **Player Must Now:**
1. **Actively dodge** frequent diving attacks
2. **Destroy enemies quickly** before formation gets too low
3. **Stay mobile** - can't camp in one spot
4. **Manage positioning** - balance offense and defense

## 🚀 **Test Results Expected**

1. **Start game** - clean console output, no debug spam
2. **Watch enemies** - more dynamic swaying in formation
3. **Wait for dives** - should see enemies diving frequently
4. **Let enemy reach bottom** - should damage player
5. **Survive 15+ seconds** - formation should move down
6. **Much more challenging** - requires active play

The game should now feel like a proper Galaga experience with real threat and challenge!
