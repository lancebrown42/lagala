# Mac Input Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue
- Buttons don't respond to clicks
- Keyboard input not detected
- No input events logged in console

## This Suggests
The problem is at the **fundamental input level** - Godot isn't receiving input events at all on your Mac.

## Step 1: Test Minimal Scene
Run the project now (CMD+B). You should see:
```
=== MINIMAL TEST STARTED ===
Godot version: {...}
Platform: macOS
If you see this, the scene is loading correctly.
Now testing input detection...
Try pressing ANY key or clicking anywhere...
Frame: 60 - Still running, waiting for input...
```

**Try:**
1. Press ANY key
2. Click anywhere in the window
3. Move the mouse

**Expected:** You should see "INPUT DETECTED!" messages

## Step 2: If No Input Detected

### Mac-Specific Solutions:

#### Solution A: Mac Permissions
1. **System Preferences** > **Security & Privacy** > **Privacy**
2. **Input Monitoring** - Add Godot if not there
3. **Accessibility** - Add Godot if not there
4. **Screen Recording** - Add Godot if not there (sometimes needed)
5. Restart Godot after adding permissions

#### Solution B: Godot Version Issues
- **Check your Godot version**: Help > About in Godot Editor
- **Mac compatibility**: Some Godot versions have Mac input bugs
- **Try different version**: Download latest stable from godotengine.org

#### Solution C: Mac Security Settings
1. **System Preferences** > **Security & Privacy** > **General**
2. If Godot is blocked, click "Allow Anyway"
3. **Gatekeeper issues**: Try running from Terminal:
   ```bash
   xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /path/to/Godot.app
   ```

#### Solution D: Window Focus Issues
1. Make sure the Godot game window has focus
2. Click on the window title bar
3. Try Alt+Tab to ensure it's the active window

#### Solution E: Input Method Issues
1. **System Preferences** > **Keyboard** > **Input Sources**
2. Make sure you're using a standard keyboard layout
3. Disable any special input methods temporarily

## Step 3: Alternative Testing Methods

### Test in Godot Editor:
1. Open the project in Godot Editor
2. **Don't press CMD+B**
3. Instead, press **F5** (Play Project)
4. Or press **F6** (Play Current Scene)
5. Or click the **Play button** in the toolbar

### Test Different Scenes:
1. In Godot Editor, open `MinimalTest.tscn`
2. Press F6 to play just that scene
3. Check if input works when run from editor vs exported

## Step 4: Debug Information Needed

Please run the minimal test and report:

1. **Console Output**: What appears in the console?
2. **Input Testing**: Any response to keys/mouse?
3. **Window Behavior**: Does the window respond to focus changes?
4. **Godot Version**: What version shows in the console?
5. **Error Messages**: Any errors in Godot's debugger?

## Step 5: Nuclear Options

If nothing works:

### Option A: Clean Install
1. Delete the entire project folder
2. Download fresh Godot
3. Create new project
4. Test with simple button

### Option B: Different Godot Build
- Try Godot 4.3 instead of 4.4
- Try different renderer (Compatibility vs Mobile)
- Try beta/RC versions

### Option C: Virtual Machine Test
- Test if it's Mac-specific by trying on different system

## Expected Behavior
When input works, you should see:
```
INPUT DETECTED! Type: InputEventKey
  KEY EVENT - Code: 65 Pressed: true
  Key pressed successfully!

INPUT DETECTED! Type: InputEventMouseButton  
  MOUSE BUTTON - Button: 1 Pressed: true
  Mouse click detected!
```

## Common Mac Issues:
1. **Permissions**: Mac blocks input access
2. **Gatekeeper**: Mac blocks unsigned apps
3. **Focus**: Window doesn't have proper focus
4. **Version**: Godot version incompatible with macOS version
5. **Architecture**: Intel vs Apple Silicon compatibility

Let me know what happens with the minimal test!
