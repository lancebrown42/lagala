# Audio Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added procedural chippy laser sounds and explosion effects to enhance the retro Galaga experience.

## New Components

### ðŸŽµ **AudioManager.gd**
- **Location**: `scripts/AudioManager.gd`
- **Purpose**: Centralized audio management with procedural sound generation
- **Features**:
  - Procedural WAV generation for authentic chiptune sounds
  - Three distinct sound types: laser, player explosion, enemy explosion
  - Static access methods for easy integration

### ðŸ”Š **Sound Effects Generated**

#### **Laser Sound** (`create_laser_wav()`)
- **Duration**: 100ms
- **Characteristics**: 
  - Frequency sweep from 800Hz to 400Hz
  - Mix of sine wave (70%) and square wave (30%) for chippiness
  - Exponential decay envelope
  - Quick attack for snappy feel

#### **Player Explosion** (`create_explosion_wav()`)
- **Duration**: 300ms
- **Characteristics**:
  - White noise base with low-frequency rumble (60Hz)
  - Slower decay for dramatic effect
  - Mix of noise (70%) and rumble (30%)

#### **Enemy Explosion** (`create_enemy_explosion_wav()`)
- **Duration**: 250ms
- **Characteristics**:
  - Higher-pitched explosion with 200Hz emphasis
  - Sharper attack and decay
  - More noise-focused for distinct enemy death sound

## Integration Points

### ðŸš€ **Player.gd** - Laser Firing
```gdscript
# In shoot() function
var audio_manager = AudioManager.get_audio_manager()
if audio_manager:
    audio_manager.play_laser_sound()
```

### ðŸ’¥ **Player.gd** - Player Hit
```gdscript
# In take_damage() function
var audio_manager = AudioManager.get_audio_manager()
if audio_manager:
    audio_manager.play_explosion_sound()
```

### ðŸ‘¾ **Enemy.gd** - Enemy Destruction
```gdscript
# In destroy() function
var audio_manager = AudioManager.get_audio_manager()
if audio_manager:
    audio_manager.play_enemy_explosion_sound()
```

### ðŸŽ¬ **Main.tscn** - Scene Integration
- Added AudioManager node as child of Main
- Proper script resource linking with UID
- Automatic initialization on scene load

## Technical Details

### **Audio Format**
- **Sample Rate**: 22,050 Hz (classic retro rate)
- **Format**: 32-bit float WAV
- **Channels**: Mono
- **Generation**: Real-time procedural synthesis

### **Performance Considerations**
- Sounds generated on-demand to avoid memory overhead
- Short durations to prevent audio overlap issues
- Lightweight AudioStreamPlayer instances
- Non-blocking playback with overlap prevention

### **Retro Authenticity**
- Square wave harmonics for authentic chiptune character
- Classic frequency ranges (400-800Hz for laser)
- Sharp envelopes typical of 8-bit era
- Noise-based explosions mimicking early arcade games

## Files Modified/Added

### **New Files**
- `scripts/AudioManager.gd` - Core audio system
- `scripts/AudioManager.gd.uid` - Godot resource identifier
- `test_audio.gd` - Audio system validation script

### **Modified Files**
- `scripts/Player.gd` - Added laser and explosion sounds
- `scripts/Enemy.gd` - Added enemy explosion sound
- `scenes/Main.tscn` - Integrated AudioManager node

### **Directory Structure**
```
assets/
â””â”€â”€ sounds/          # Created for future audio assets
scripts/
â”œâ”€â”€ AudioManager.gd  # New audio system
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

## Usage
The audio system is fully integrated and will automatically:
1. **Play laser sound** when player shoots (Space key)
2. **Play player explosion** when player takes damage
3. **Play enemy explosion** when enemies are destroyed

No additional setup required - sounds are generated procedurally at runtime!

## Benefits
- âœ… **Authentic retro sound** - True chiptune character
- âœ… **Zero external dependencies** - All sounds generated in-engine
- âœ… **Lightweight** - No audio file storage needed
- âœ… **Customizable** - Easy to tweak parameters for different effects
- âœ… **Performance optimized** - Minimal memory footprint
- âœ… **Immediate feedback** - Enhances gameplay responsiveness
