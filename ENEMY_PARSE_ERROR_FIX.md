# Enemy Parse Error Fix - Final Solution

## 🔧 **Root Cause Identified**
The parse error on line 13 was caused by `texture = preload("res://icon.svg")` - the icon.svg file may not be properly imported or accessible during scene loading.

## ✅ **Final Fix Applied**

### **Removed Problematic Preload**
```gdscript
# REMOVED this line that was causing parse error:
texture = preload("res://icon.svg")
```

### **Updated Enemy.tscn Structure**
```
[node name="Sprite2D" type="Sprite2D" parent="."]
modulate = Color(1, 0.2, 0.2, 1)
scale = Vector2(0.375, 0.375)
# No texture preload - will be set at runtime
```

### **Enhanced Enemy.gd Sprite Setup**
- Uses SpriteGenerator to create enemy texture at runtime
- Fallback to programmatically created red rectangle if SpriteGenerator fails
- No dependency on external texture files

## 🎮 **Testing Added**

### **SimpleEnemyTest.gd**
- Loads Enemy.tscn and reports success/failure
- Instantiates enemy and adds to scene
- Provides clear success/failure messages
- Runs automatically when game starts

### **Expected Output**
```
=== SIMPLE ENEMY LOADING TEST ===
Testing Enemy.tscn loading...
✅ SUCCESS: Enemy.tscn loaded successfully
✅ SUCCESS: Enemy instantiated successfully
✅ SUCCESS: Enemy added to scene at position (100, 100)
```

## 🚀 **How to Test**

1. **Run the game** - SimpleEnemyTest runs automatically after 1 second
2. **Check console** for enemy loading success messages
3. **Look for test enemy** - should appear briefly at position (100, 100)
4. **Start game normally** - enemies should now spawn in formation

## 🔍 **If Still Failing**

The SimpleEnemyTest will show exactly what's wrong:

**Parse Error Still Occurs:**
- Check if there are any remaining syntax issues in Enemy.tscn
- Verify all brackets and quotes are balanced
- Look for any remaining preload() statements

**Scene Loads but Instantiation Fails:**
- Enemy.gd script may have issues
- Check if Enemy class is properly defined
- Verify _ready() function doesn't have errors

**Instantiation Works but Enemies Don't Spawn:**
- EnemyManager issue (separate from scene loading)
- Check EnemyManager debug output
- Verify start_wave() is being called

## 📋 **Key Changes Summary**

1. **Removed texture preload** from Enemy.tscn (line 13 fix)
2. **Added runtime texture creation** in Enemy.gd
3. **Enhanced error handling** with fallback textures
4. **Added comprehensive testing** with SimpleEnemyTest
5. **Maintained all enemy functionality** while fixing parse error

The Enemy.tscn file should now load without any parse errors, and enemies should spawn properly when the game starts!
