# Final Debug Cleanup & Premature Wave Fix

## 🧹 **Debug Output Completely Cleaned**

### **Shot Logging Disabled:**
- ✅ **Player.gd** - "Player fired bullet at:" removed
- ✅ **Main.gd** - "Player shot fired" and "Bullet fired at position:" removed

### **Formation Logging Disabled:**
- ✅ **EnemyManager.gd** - All formation position spam removed
- ✅ **generate_formation_positions()** - No more coordinate dumps
- ✅ **start_wave()** - Minimal output only
- ✅ **clear_all_enemies()** - No more stack traces

### **Wave Completion Logging Cleaned:**
- ✅ **complete_wave()** - Essential messages only
- ✅ **Player visibility checks** - Removed redundant logging

## 🔧 **Premature Wave Completion Fixed**

### **Root Cause:**
The EnemyManager was initializing with `wave_complete = false` and `enemies_alive = []` (empty), which immediately triggered wave completion before the game started.

### **Fix Applied:**
```gdscript
# In EnemyManager._ready():
wave_complete = true   # Start with wave complete (no premature trigger)
current_wave = 0       # Start at wave 0, will be set to 1 when game starts
```

### **Result:**
- ✅ **No premature wave completion** on startup
- ✅ **Wave only completes** when enemies are actually destroyed
- ✅ **Clean game start** without false wave signals

## 🎮 **Player Visibility Fixed**

### **Issue:**
Debug showed "Player visible: false" during wave transitions.

### **Fix Applied:**
```gdscript
func _on_wave_complete(wave_number: int):
    # Ensure player stays visible during wave transitions
    if player:
        player.visible = true
```

### **Result:**
- ✅ **Player stays visible** throughout gameplay
- ✅ **No disappearing player** during wave transitions

## 📋 **Expected Clean Console Output**

### **Game Start:**
```
Lagala Game Manager initialized
Player ship initialized
Main scene loaded
Start button pressed - calling game_manager.start_game()
Game started signal received
Starting wave 1
Game started!
```

### **During Gameplay:**
```
Wave 1 complete!
Starting next wave in 3 seconds...
Starting wave 2...
```

### **No More Spam:**
- ❌ Shot fired messages
- ❌ Formation position coordinates
- ❌ Stack traces
- ❌ Verbose debug blocks
- ❌ Player visibility checks
- ❌ Signal emission confirmations

## 🚀 **Test Results Expected**

1. **Start game** - Clean console, no premature wave completion
2. **Shoot bullets** - No shot logging spam
3. **Complete wave** - Clean wave transition messages
4. **Player always visible** - No disappearing issues
5. **Enemies spawn only after START** - No premature spawning

The game should now have professional, clean console output with only essential gameplay messages!
