# Phase 2 Testing Checklist

## Automated Tests Results ✅
- ✅ All Phase 2 files created successfully
- ✅ Player script validation passed (all key components present)
- ✅ Bullet script validation passed (physics and collision ready)
- ✅ Scene files properly structured with correct node types
- ✅ All GDScript syntax validation passed

## Manual Testing Instructions

### To test Phase 2 in Godot Editor:

1. **Open and Run Project**
   - Launch Godot 4.4+ and open the project
   - Press F5 to run the game
   - **Expected**: No script errors, game loads normally

2. **Start Game and Player Visibility**
   - Click "START GAME" button
   - **Expected**: 
     - Blue triangular player ship appears at bottom center
     - Player ship is visible and properly positioned
     - HUD shows score and lives

3. **Player Movement Test**
   - Press A or Left Arrow key
   - **Expected**: Player ship moves left smoothly
   - Press D or Right Arrow key  
   - **Expected**: Player ship moves right smoothly
   - **Expected**: Ship has acceleration/deceleration (not instant movement)

4. **Boundary Collision Test**
   - Hold A/Left until ship reaches left edge
   - **Expected**: Ship stops at screen boundary, doesn't go off-screen
   - Hold D/Right until ship reaches right edge
   - **Expected**: Ship stops at screen boundary, doesn't go off-screen

5. **Shooting System Test**
   - Press Space bar
   - **Expected**: 
     - Yellow bullet appears above player ship
     - Bullet moves upward at constant speed
     - Console shows "Player fired bullet" message

6. **Fire Rate Limiting Test**
   - Hold Space bar continuously
   - **Expected**: 
     - Bullets fire at controlled rate (not continuously)
     - Maximum 3 bullets on screen at once
     - New bullets only fire when old ones disappear

7. **Bullet Physics Test**
   - Fire bullets and watch them travel
   - **Expected**:
     - Bullets move straight up
     - Bullets disappear when they reach top of screen
     - No memory leaks or performance issues

8. **Console Debug Output**
   - Check Godot console for messages:
   - **Expected messages**:
     - "Player ship initialized"
     - "Screen size: (640, 480)"
     - "Player fired bullet at: [position]"
     - Phase 2 tester output with all ✓ marks

## Advanced Testing

9. **Performance Test**
   - Fire many bullets rapidly
   - **Expected**: Smooth 60fps performance, no stuttering

10. **Input Responsiveness Test**
    - Test rapid direction changes
    - **Expected**: Ship responds immediately to input changes

## Success Criteria for Phase 2:
- ✅ Player ship visible and properly positioned
- ✅ Smooth movement with A/D and arrow keys
- ✅ Ship stays within screen boundaries
- ✅ Shooting works with Space key
- ✅ Fire rate limiting prevents bullet spam
- ✅ Maximum 3 bullets on screen enforced
- ✅ Bullets move upward and disappear off-screen
- ✅ No script errors or performance issues
- ✅ Console shows appropriate debug messages

## Known Phase 2 Limitations:
- Bullets don't hit anything yet (no enemies)
- No explosion effects
- Simple placeholder sprites
- No sound effects yet

## If Issues Are Found:

### Common Issues and Solutions:

1. **Player ship not visible**
   - Check that player.visible = true in show_game_screen()
   - Verify sprite texture is being set in setup_player_sprite()

2. **Movement not working**
   - Check input actions in Project Settings
   - Verify handle_movement() is being called in _physics_process()

3. **Shooting not working**
   - Check that bullet_scene is properly loaded
   - Verify PlayerBullet.tscn path is correct

4. **Bullets not moving**
   - Check velocity is set in PlayerBullet._ready()
   - Verify _physics_process() is updating position

## Next Steps:
Once Phase 2 testing is complete and all features work correctly, proceed to Phase 3: Enemy System Implementation.

Phase 3 will add:
- Enemy formation and movement
- Enemy shooting
- Collision detection between player bullets and enemies
- Score system integration
